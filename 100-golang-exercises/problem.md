# 100 Coding problems to improve coding in Go.

### Exercise 001: Find numbers divisable by 7 but not by 5
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

### Exercise 002: Compute factorial
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8
Then, the output should be: 40320

### Exercise 003 : Create a map with numbers squared
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a map that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included), and then the program should print the map with representation of the value.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8
Then, the output should be: map[1:1 2:4 3:9 4:16 5:25 6:36 7:49 8:64]

### Exercise 004 : Create a slice from comma-seperated input string
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate an slice out of them. Return the slice.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 34, 67, 55, 33, 12, 98.
Then, the output should be: [34 67 55 33 12 98]

### Exercise 005 : Define a "class" (interface) which has at least two methods
Create a seperate file (module) which has at least two methods:
- ReadString: to read a string from console input
- PrintString: to return the string in upper case.
Also create a main.go file that acts as calling class.
